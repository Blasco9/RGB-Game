Simple color guessing game from The Web Developer Bootcamp. For this project I copied the original dessign but used my own code for the logic

## How to play
At the start the default mode is hard but you can change it to easy.
- **Hard mode**: 6 diferent colors to guess from.
- **Easy mode**: 3 diferent colors to guess from.  

To choose a color just click on a square. You have to pick the color that the rgb value in the title represents.  
If you want to try again after wining just click on **PLAY AGAIN?**
